# INFO-403-project
This repository contains all the code and explaination on the project for the course of "Introduction to language theory and compiling".

There is a makefile to compile. If you use the "make testing" command you execute the lexer and the parser on Factorial.fs.
You will obtain the left-derivation in stdout and the derivation tree as Factorial.tex
