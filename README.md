# INFO-403-project
This repository contains all the code and explaination on the project for the course of "Introduction to language theory and compiling".

There is a makefile to compile. If you use the "make basic" command you execute the lexer and the parser on Factorial.fs.
You will obtain the derivation tree as Factorial.tex and the simplified one as simple_Factorial.tex
You will also obtain the corresponding LLVM code in stdout.
